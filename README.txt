# Spaced Repetition Calendar:
A terminal run python program which helps keep a track of which subject to study on a given day based on the Spaced Repetition method.
The final.py file in the sparep calendar folder is the usable code.

Description:
The program uses a database to store the dates and the topics which has been implemented using sqlite3 library available in python. It also uses plyer module to run the notification system of Windows which helps us to remind the user what to study.

How to use:
1. Run the exe file, a terminal window will open asking for an input
2. Initially as the database is empty, enter the things you study for a couple of days, populate the database.
3. Once done, the reminder system can be used.
